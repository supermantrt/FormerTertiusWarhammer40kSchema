BACKGROUND.name = "Renegade"
BACKGROUND.description = "The Imperium survives and prospers is not a small part due to the narrowness of its vision, and by the strictures imposed by high walls, hars orders, and obedient faith on worlds where no man looks beyond the simple rote taught in childhood. A rebellious mind such as yours could not be so easily constrained however but you have had to pay a price for your freedom and have learned those high walls are there for a reason. Perhaps you were a visionary in search of strange knowledge, seeking answers to questions those around you would never think to ask, answers that proved dark indeed. Perhaps you were denied the sanctity of the God-Emperor's church in your heart and fled its shackles of faith, or fought as part of a blood revolt against the tyranny and injustice of your home world. In any case, you saw your only options to be escape or death. Now, the stars beyond await you with the possibility of freedoms and powers unguessed and perils unknown."
