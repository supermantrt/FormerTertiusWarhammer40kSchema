BACKGROUND.name = "Outcast"
BACKGROUND.description = "The Imperium where most are born into the same position for life, there are those that work their way free to make a life on their own. Some have deliberately forsaken the role they were given, or slipped between the cracks and exist as criminals and renegades on the fringes. Outcasts live in the shadows of society surviving by pure wit and charm. Every day is a challenge of survival however most become able thieves, assassins or even bounty hunters. No matter what is done by these outcasts, suspicion and fear is at their every step and others know wherever they tread, crime always follows. Despite this reputation which they hold, an outcast can be connected to many levels of society. The concerns they hold are primarily their own but they can be enlisted for larger pursuits as their connections, knowledge and skills are unheard of from a normal denizen. A willingness to use bribery, coercion and other base appeals have made them effective and valuable, more effective than simple calls to duty that is."
