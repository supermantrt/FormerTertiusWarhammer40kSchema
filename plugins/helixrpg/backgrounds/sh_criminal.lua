BACKGROUND.name = "Criminal"
BACKGROUND.description = "You tend to forget what you did before you came onto this crew. The hardships of the world seem best forgotten with your previous life being nothing but a stain. A stain which you cannot always forget. You were a criminal, you do not really remember what you did but it was good enough to leave you with a hundred bounty hunters looking for your head. An arbites is even heard to be in your case but you hope it is just random gossip. It seems like life was simple back then but with this extra baggage you feel it everywhere. You just hope that your past does not catch up with you. These adventures continue and maybe one day if you are lucky you can settle far away where no one will ever bring up your checkered past again."
