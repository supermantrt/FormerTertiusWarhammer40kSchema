BACKGROUND.name = "Deathwish"
BACKGROUND.description = "None of your old confidants know what happened or if they did they are long gone. The people around you dont even know what causes this. You yourself dont even know why you do this but in all regards and actions it has been displayed you seek death. Your dreams are littered with butchered bodies and beasts or people of horrid figures. Their stances twisted and contorted, ripping you apart piece by piece. In your mind all you can hear is endless bickering and the people around you seem wrong. You swear their faces are wrong and contorted, almost making a mockery of you. This has all culminated in a strong urge to end your life. You display reckless abandon for your own safety and seem to jump at the chance for dangerous activities. Your life before this you were on the verge of ending it all but you somehow convinced yourself to join this crew. It may have been some genius idea or some self preservation but you now volunteer for the most dangerous of missions hoping that one day your death will mean something."
