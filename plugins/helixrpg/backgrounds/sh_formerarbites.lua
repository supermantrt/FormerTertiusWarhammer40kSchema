BACKGROUND.name = "Former Adeptus Arbites"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were once a respected arbiter of justice. You had dealt with crime from the planetary underhives to the massive decks of ships where no one was too far for your hand of justice. This willingness to traverse the deepest reaches of life has left you with many experiences and your unflinching dedication to justice as a shield from the horrors. You continued this diligently until something occurred. It was a single case you had been trailing for what seemed like decades. You had been slowly building it all together matching the pieces but before you could figure it out something occurred that made you leave. An uncommon occurrence but with an arbities on the middle of a case? They let you go somehow. You yourself will only know what you find in that case that caused you to leave, be it willing or not. This departure left you destitute but a rogue trader had their eye on you since an encounter. It is here you may be able to come to terms of what happened and rekindle that justice you held so dear."
