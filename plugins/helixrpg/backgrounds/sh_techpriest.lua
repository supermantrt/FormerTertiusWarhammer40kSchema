BACKGROUND.name = "Techpriest"
BACKGROUND.description = "The flesh which fails surrounds you everywhere. The meaty things they call bodies sicken you to your core and the failures of the others to see the grand picture disturbs you greatly. You are an official part of the Adeptus Mechanicus which has ended up in the service of this group. The reasoning and methods lie with you alone but the outcomes are clear. You will have to suffer these flesh things for a while longer. The search of knowledge has been the largest driving factor for many a techpriest to find long lost knowledge but your own goals are still uncertain. One can only presume this is the reason you hear in the whispers of the crew. One thing is but certain and that whatever has driven you from your isolation among your kind into the center of this group will be a strange one."
