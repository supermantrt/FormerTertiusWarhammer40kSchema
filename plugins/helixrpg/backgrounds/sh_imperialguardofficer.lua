BACKGROUND.name = "Former Imperial Guard Officer"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were once a respected imperial officer of the astra militarum, you cannot remember much of the times before with you either deserting or coming back from retirement. You yourself only truly remember what made you switch your life into this but whatever it was left a mark. You still have that old strict discipline and expect nothing but order within the operation when it is conducted. You rarely see any of this when going on an operation but rigor and drill always break them in the end. You have been saying this for what feels like an eternity but life continues on. Your adjustment to this lifestyle will take some time but you believe with some competent tactics and the proper cohesion this group of motley men may one day rival the men you once led or maybe even surpass themâ€¦ Probably not."
