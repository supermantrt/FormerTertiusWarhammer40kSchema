BACKGROUND.description = "The life of a Sanctioned Psyker is truly a tragic one indeed, even from the beginning. Upon birth when detected, if they manage to survive the Sanctioned Psyker will be taken to Holy Terra, where they are subjected to many trials in order to wash out the weak. Some Psykers are incinerated in the holy inferno of the God-Emperor, and the others are taken by the various organisations that exist under the Adeptus Terra. If a Sanctioned Psyker does indeed survive, they are raised and trained in the fortress of the Adeptus Astra Telepathica known as 'Obsidian Keep' wherein they hone their powers and train. Astropaths, remain in Obsidian Keep for a greater amount of time as their powers require further assistance in nurturing, while Combat Psykers are sent out to a Coven sometimes as soon as right after their Sanctioning takes place, with them being there only to have their identities updated."
