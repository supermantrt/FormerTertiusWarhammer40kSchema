BACKGROUND.name = "Outcast Techpriest"
BACKGROUND.description = "A Techpriest of your own class, you've been exiled from the Machine Cult for one reason or another. Be it a strange interest with research some may consider forbidden, or experiments that resulted in excommunication from the Machine Cult. Whatever may have been done did not result in your execution, nor a branding of being a Heretek, a mercy, but a cruel one. Your belief in the Machine God stays with you yet your standing with the Mechanicus is naught, and by your peers you're seen as an outcast often shunned and distrusted. Many others of a less dogmatic disposition may consider your presence something useful to be had as your mind is freed from many of the strict strictures of the Machine Cult and have a much more open mind to more peculiar studies. Even so you will always be an outcast and you will always be reminded of this fact by both peers and allies alike."
