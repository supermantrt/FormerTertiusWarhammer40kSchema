BACKGROUND.name = "Former Special Forces"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were once part of the elite task force of your regiment. Little is known publicly about this group. Few were privy to your existence. The operations you were tasked on were often close to a death sentence. These conditions took their toll on your mind and body but you still crawled forward. These missions were vast with you committing many unspeakable acts. The last mission of yours was different. There was something that broke within your mind. You yourself will ever know what happened on that fateful day but whatever it was caused you to go AWOL. You were trained expertly to handle many situations, perhaps too well as you were able to bypass all their measures. You escaped and looking for a new life has led you to this ship. Officially you do not exist and this should be no cause of concern for most. The imperium is vast and many an untold individual slips through yet something still bothers you. You swear the shadows move when you are not looking but for all you know it is just paranoia."
