BACKGROUND.name = "Drifter"
BACKGROUND.description = "You once had a home a long time ago, how long ago you can no longer tell. In your youth you never had steadied feet and always dreamed of the great beyond. You grew up and you decided to abandon it all. You do not remember much of what you left behind, may it be your lover or family. The imperium has many endless faces coming and going. The endless movement across the galaxy has left you with many stories but most do not tell. The stories they share are often unfinished and leave many frustrated extracting anything more. They often decide to pick up one day and just leave so it is nought of if they will but when. You are one of these drifters pairing up with the ship to travel to some untold places. They often search for something they can never find and many others wonder what it is you search for."
