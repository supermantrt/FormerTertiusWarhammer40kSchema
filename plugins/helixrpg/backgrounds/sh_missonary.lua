BACKGROUND.name = "Missonary"
BACKGROUND.description = "Regardless of local idiosyncrasies of doctrine and the many varied forms of worship, the worlds of the Imperium are united in adoration of the God-Emperor of Mankind. The adepts of the Ecclesiarchy foster, maintain and impose faith across the million and more worlds of the Imperium, but it is the division known as the Missionarus Galaxia that takes the word of the Imperial Truth to those berighted by ignorance of the one, true faith of Mankind. The Missionary is a singular manifestation of the Ecclesiarchy, a walking temple dressed in the trappings of his calling, part holy warrior, part politician and when needed , judge, jury and executioner. His mission: to spread the teachings of the Ecclesiarchy far beyond the Imperium's borders and to convert the ignorant, whether using words, bullets, or subterfuge. He shall spread the word of the Emperor to the Human worlds he encounters amongst the distant stars."
