BACKGROUND.name = "PDF Deserter"
BACKGROUND.description = "Every planet in the Imperium has different views, culture and a widely differing hierarchy which governs it. Some are lucky to be born on a Paradise World filled with a beautiful ecosystem that is a calming sight to even gaze upon, where life consists of enjoyment and pleasure. Many others are less fortunate. Those unlucky souls are born in places such as Hive World Underhives, where each day is a fight to survive amongst others, and where experience is everything. No matter where you were born, your wish to leave it has won your mind. It may have been foolish ambition, a foolhardy desire for a better life free of the strictures of a monarch or maybe an ambitious wish to experience more than your simplistic placement in the Imperium. A dream to cross the stars and beyond."
