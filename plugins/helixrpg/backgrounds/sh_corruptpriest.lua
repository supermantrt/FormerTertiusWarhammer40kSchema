BACKGROUND.name = "Corrupt Priest"
BACKGROUND.description = "A preacher of truth, a demagogue of the people, the voice of the emperor. You went by many titles but chief among them was 'negotiable' and 'understanding'. You were never one to shy away from the mortal realms physical delights. You took great pleasure in such things but they usually came at a rather large price. You deemed it reasonable then to accept more than just some meager donations. You saw an opportunity to live life to the fullest and so decided to accept peoples offers. You gave a purity seal here and there and perhaps a blind eye to heresy sometimes. In the end though your indulgence in the material world may have caused some jealousy. You heard from a trusted confidant that an ecclesiarchy higher up was coming to pay you a visit. In the end you left all your belongings behind and fled to safety among this crew. You have heard stories of great wealth so maybe you will be able to once more live the life that the god emperor always intended you to do."
