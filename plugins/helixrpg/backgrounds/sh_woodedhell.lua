BACKGROUND.name = "Forest Stalker"
BACKGROUND.description = "The leaves crunch under every aching footstep. Famished and broken you wandered this green hell. You had long come to accept this place as your end. Your death was thought to be sealed by the powers that be. If you were destined to die in this hell of trees you won't be leaving this mortal plane without a fight. You learned to survive among the trees excelling in such harsh conditions where weaker men failed but you thrived. You were once a soldier but time has worn your memory thin. Your training helped you survive the first few days but this jungle, forest or green hell was what taught you everything you knew. There were times where your mind wandered but you always steeled yourself and for this you were rewarded. A scouting party of a rogue trader found youâ€¦ well you them. You found an escape from this hell. You were abandoned but now you are free. You are free from those shackles that held you. You sometimes wonder if you will find the men that once shackled you there."
