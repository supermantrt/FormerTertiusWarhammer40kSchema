BACKGROUND.name = "Penal Legionaire"
BACKGROUND.description = "The Imperial Guard is an army collected by loose threads, strict rules and even stricter enforcers, something you for one reason or another did not want to abide by. It may have been your attitude towards your superiors causing them to spare you by sending you into a Penal Legion or perhaps it was the string of continuous petty thefts for your survival or others that spared you, and many other possible reasons. The Penal Legionaire's life is harsh indeed, barely above that of slaves although some may challenge that notions. You managed to live though. Each day was hardship but you survived it through either well applied wit or adamantium strength will."
