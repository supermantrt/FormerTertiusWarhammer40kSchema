BACKGROUND.name = "Abandoned Sister Of Battle"
BACKGROUND.description = "It was a simple mission that day. You and your squad had made touchdown on the planet and the enemy should have been nowhere near the landing zone. It seems they were wrong. Your squadmates were butchered and only faith steadied you but even then at the end you were overwhelmed. A strike from the chaos of battle left you incapacited as you saw your other sisters die in the droves, brave to the bitter end. They were stronger than you... better. When they left you dragged yourself from under the fallen and began the long journey of recovery. The squad thought you were destroyed, you were left marooned and slowly withered away. It was only by chance you were able to find this motley group during one of their escapades that you were able to leave that wretched planet. The order having long forgotten you and the memories of the fallen haunting your memories you travel with this group seeking redemption for your past failures."
