BACKGROUND.name = "Heretek"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were always a person of a more ‘enthusiastic’ and ‘creative’ disposition when it came to problem solving.. You may have decided to take the cult mechanicus rules and discard them entirely from your memory banks. You had been constantly interfacing with technology and inventing things that the mechanicus official would deem abhorrent but you were always able to stay disguised through means of subterfuge and trickery. This was until you made a mistake that landed you in hot water. A simple mistake that you really only know about but in the end could have branded you Heretek. You were able to escape this branding narrowly avoiding it with a few favors but could not afford to remain. You were fortunate enough to meet this group which while finding your story suspect did seem enamored by your technical knowledge. In no time you left those that searched for you behind and joined with them hoping to discover more. The experimentations for you should continue uninterrupted for now."
