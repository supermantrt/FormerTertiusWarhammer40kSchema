BACKGROUND.name = "Disgraced Commissar"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were looked up to but you left them. You were once a man of the imperium who the regular guardsmen were inspired by but you lost it all. Everything you had worked for had been taken away. You felt bitter and angry. In public among the crew you still hold yourself in high regard. You have never told them exactly what made you leave the commissariat. The reality was you ran and disgraced the position. You did many horrible things. The fight that day against the enemy was too much that day and you had decided to leave your post. You can't remember really but upon doing so the battle turned and men fled. In a fit of rage or panic you shot the men that retreated because of you. There were too many and realizing your massive foley you ran. You ran to the nearest town where this band had found you and offered you a place. They did not care and here you ended up. Disgraced and most likely dead if found. Your hope is that you are able to find yourself pardoned and redeem yourself in their service."
