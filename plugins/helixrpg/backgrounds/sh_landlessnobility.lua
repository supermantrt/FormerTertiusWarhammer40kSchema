BACKGROUND.name = "Landless Nobility"
BACKGROUND.description = "A once prestigious house brought to decay and ruin. The lands you once called your own had been swept right from under you be it from brute force or guile. Your lands once opulent and decadent now stand forgotten. The claims of your family to them slowly wither away as other generations of nobility take its place. You though have not forgotten the land taken from you. This is but a temporary setback and these conditions are rife to gain enough thrones to retake your land. The lands you once called your own will be returned eventuallyâ€¦ but for now it is best to bide your time and explore the galaxy. The group you have joined with is a rogue trader it seems and its crew is some strange motley group. You feel as if in no time at all you will be returning to your land that you own."
