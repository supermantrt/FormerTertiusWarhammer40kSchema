BACKGROUND.name = "Noble's Bastard"
BACKGROUND.description = "You should have been born in purple with fine jewelry and silver cutlery. A life of glamor and excitement with unending pleasantries. The fine balls you would have attended would have been worth thousands of individuals' meager pay. A right to a happy life. That was your birthright by blood. A birthright that was taken from you. You were born to a scandalous affair between a nobleman and servant. The life you had was from the beginning full of hardship. A mother that fled to escape certain death and continued to avoid it after you were born. These affairs are far too common but what was rare was surviving this ordeal. Your wits kept you both alive until a bounty hunter with little care brought a corpse that was not our own. You grew to survive the hardships but few knew of your true origin. When your mother eventually died you had nothing left tieing you to your home and so you set off. You began to wander to earn your stake in his harsh galaxy and to reclaim what was deserved to you by blood. "
