BACKGROUND.name = "Mercenary"
BACKGROUND.description = "A gun-for-hire, or some other form of militaristic service offered to those willing to pay the price. Mercenaries care nothing for the mission, only for their payment, as without it they would surely perish in the abyss of Humanity, left to rot without help. Some take this occupation willingly, seeing this path as a step-up from whatever station they previously possessed, ignoring the possibilities of consequences with blind ambition. Those less fortunate were forced into this role by situation, a cruel yet merciful act by fate. These individuals may have a chance to survive and gain wealth or glory. They may even one day be able to escape this position. The job possesses countless dangers, some of which may be worse than simply accepting the hand which has been dealt to you and living with it in the darkness of your own mind."
