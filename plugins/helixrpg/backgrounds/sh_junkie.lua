BACKGROUND.description = "The next hit, the next rush, the next dopamine kick that is all you live for. You have been an adrenaline junky your whole life and when that wasn't enough you got hooked and some addictive substances. The crew thinks your body is some sort of magic for surviving this long but you somehow managed. The lower grade stuff eventually lost its potency and you kept getting more and more hard stuff. This led you to getting more desperate to fuel this addiction and to find even harder illicit substances to give you that kick. You were eventually spotted by this group and for some reason one of the officers took a liking to you. Most likely due to you being even more desperate than the average individual due to this addiction and rogue traders always enjoy a bit of leverage over someone. You are now employed in their service and are expected to do the most grueling tasks. The crew does not expect you to live for much longer."
