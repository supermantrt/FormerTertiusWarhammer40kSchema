BACKGROUND.name = "Reluctant Priest"
BACKGROUND.description = "Being send to the Adeptus Ministorum when he was a child by his rich parents he never really bought all the faithful prayers and other stories that were thrown at him, on the contrary as the years went by he has grown a distaste and partial hatred for the Imperial Cult. It took his childhood and life away and now he is stuck as some priest who is forced to spread the word of the Emperor. He is not happy about it and his enthusiasm can be seen as he allows many transgressions against the faith, but now perhaps a new story in his life can open? One free of this faith which has shackled him all his life."
