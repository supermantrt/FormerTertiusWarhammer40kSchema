BACKGROUND.name = "Scavenger"
BACKGROUND.description = "You became an adult amidst the yearning and poverty of the God-Emperor's flock, one soul amongst countless underhivers, renegades, bonepickers and a thousand other outcast castes that exist on the fringes of the Imperium. Scavenging what they can to survive. All that you owned was claimed from the wastes of those far above you in the Imperial Hierarchy or gleaned from the wreckage and ashes of past war and catastrophe--at least, everything that wasn't taken from the bodies of your peers and rivals of course. Yours was a hard life lived upon a knife edge: a dark abyss of starvation on one side and death or far worse on the other. A childhood where each day of survival was a triumph that has hardened and honed you, but left its scars on your soul."
