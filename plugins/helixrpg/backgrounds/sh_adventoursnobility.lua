BACKGROUND.name = "Adventurous Noble"
BACKGROUND.description = "The life of high society was rather drab and dull. The listening of concerns of administration was tedious and the constant rumors or gossip frustrating. You lived a life of luxury. A life of almost pure bliss but of extreme boredom. You began to see life as nothing but the monotonous routine of dealing with minor tasks before hearing about some scandal. You felt as if you were missing something. The galaxy was so far and wide yet all you had ever seen was this single planet's features. Even with the decadence it felt hollow and you yearned for something more. You do not really remember what the calling was that led you out of this cushy life. It maybe was a long dead cousin from another system but whatever it was it made for an excuse. The stars filled your eyes and your imagination ran wild with adventure. You were fortunate enough to meet the group when they were on the way to trade within this planet. You were able to somehow join them and together you have been traversing the stars."
