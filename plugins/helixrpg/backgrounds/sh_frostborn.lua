BACKGROUND.name = "Frostborn"
BACKGROUND.description = "The endless stretch of white wastes is all you have ever called home. There you endured in conditions that no man or beast should have been able to live. A white wasteland devoid of anything. There was not much known on your planet. There were stories of a lush world brought to kneel in endless frost or of foolhardy settlers. The strongest among them only survived and centuries would pass before two groups would ever meet on the planet. Nomads of the ice plains and conquers of the cold you were. Life went on but you were one day left alone. You yourself will only know what happened on that tragic day but you survived by yourself in the white waste. You were lucky to somehow meet a frozen corpse. People from outside this world and following the trail lead you to this group. You are employed now in the service of the rogue trader. You seek purpose after what life you had vanished but you still feel that even the void of space is warmer than what you left behind."
