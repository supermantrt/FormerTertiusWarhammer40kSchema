BACKGROUND.description = "Whispers across the ship talk about you. When you walk by they become hushed and just stare before you leave their view to continue. You were once part of a vicious underhive gang known for its brutality and cunning. Not much has been said about your past with them other than you with them since your childhood and such an environment molded you. The underhive can still appear in your dreams, sometimes calling you back. Little is known why you left life for this. Perhaps it was to escape this desperate struggle of life or death but perhaps it was for some other purpose. In any case whatever that purpose was you yourself only know it. The underhive has left its mark with you having extreme strength and agility. Your wits are as sharp as a knife but when it comes to the more advanced technical nature of things or on the matters of leadership and discipline you are found lacking. Your view of the world was always different but in the underhives one thing is certain. Might makes right."
