TRAIT.name = "Lost Humanity"
TRAIT.description = "The galaxy has many frightful features that ravage the person's mind. The most disturbing part is you seem to be unaffected. When others stare at the horrors of the galaxy and are driven insane you just seem to shrug. It seems that sometimes this causes people to fear you more than the horrors presented to them."
