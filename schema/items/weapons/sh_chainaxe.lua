ITEM.name = "Chain-Axe"
ITEM.description = "The Chainaxe is a type of Chain Weapon. It takes the form of an axe with motorized monomolecular chainsaw teeth and is able to tear through both flesh and armour with relative ease. While a chainsword may be wielded with apparent finesse, the chainaxe is a more simple and savage affair. The added leverage of the long haft allows its wide chain edge, makes for a heavier strike with each blow, but with less control or precision. Like a regular axe, these can have one edge or be two-sided. Each open edge contains its own chain loop, meaning that the double-sided version can still operate if one side is fouled. The weapon is often favoured by those who favour offence over defence or appreciate the hideous damage and terror these axes evoke. These axes come in both one and two-handed varients."
