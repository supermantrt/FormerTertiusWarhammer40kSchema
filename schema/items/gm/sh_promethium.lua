ITEM.description = "Promethium is a general, catch-all term used for any form of combustible fuel in the Imperium of Man, including refined hydrocarbons and the various isotopes of hydrogen used as both fuel and reaction mass in Imperial Plasma Generators and starship drives. The term promethium also refers more specifically to the substance that is the 41st Millennium's equivalent of napalm, a highly volatile incendiary gel derived in part from refined hydrocarbons which immediately ignites on contact with oxygen and is used in Imperial Flamer Weapons to provide a lethal stream of fire. This form of promethium reaches super-hot temperatures. Similar to napalm, this gel sticks to an individual, continuing to burn on its own accord, even underwater and in the vacuum of space (igniting the substance it is sticking to)."
